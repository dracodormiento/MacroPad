Chose this macro pad, as it uses the RP2040 microcontroller. I wanted to explore Circuit Python.
The CircuitPython environment was a lot of fun, as you edit the files directly on the microcontroller's mass storage, and it reboots upon saving the file
This microcontroller was also chosen because you can turn the mass-storage off at whim, allowing it to be used with sercure computers that don't permit mass-storage.
