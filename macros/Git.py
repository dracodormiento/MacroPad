# MACROPAD Hotkeys example: Consumer Control codes (media keys)

# The syntax for Consumer Control macros is a little peculiar, in order to
# maintain backward compatibility with the original keycode-only macro files.
# The third item for each macro is a list in brackets, and each value within
# is normally an integer (Keycode), float (delay) or string (typed literally).
# Consumer Control codes are distinguished by enclosing them in a list within
# the list, which is why you'll see double brackets [[ ]] below.
# Like Keycodes, Consumer Control codes can be positive (press) or negative
# (release), and float values can be inserted for pauses.

# To reference Consumer Control codes, import ConsumerControlCode like so...
from adafruit_hid.consumer_control_code import ConsumerControlCode
# You can still import Keycode as well if a macro file mixes types!
# See other macro files for typical Keycode examples.
